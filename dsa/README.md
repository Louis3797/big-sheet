# Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA)

Data structures and algorithms are the identity of a good programmer. They are a very important foundation of programming, so don't leave them out. You don't have to be the best and you don't have to know every data structure or algorithm, but you should have an overview.

## What is DSA?

Data structures and algorithms are the two things that will completely change your approach to programming. 
Data structures help us store data in a specific format, and algorithms are nothing more than the process you implement to solve a specific problem.

## Why is DSA important?

DSA plays a very important role in reducing the time complexity of code. There can be multiple approaches to a problem, but you have to choose the optimal one to stand out from the crowd. You have to be able to write code that takes less time to execute for a given problem. You can do this by learning DSA. If you master DSA properly, you will be able to write better code.

### Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis

Before we get into DSA, let's first have a look at Big-O.

I have left you a few videos that you can use to learn. Watch as many as you want until you understand everything. If you don't understand everything right away, it doesn't matter, you can always come back and watch everything again in detail.
