# Big Sheet 

#### Hey im Louis, I study computer science in Germany.

## What is this?

This is a collection of videos, my own transcripts and code implementations

So as not to be misunderstood: This is not a study plan that you have to go through from front to back, but a summary of the topics I learned during my studies and from myself. So most of the stuff can be learned without much knowledge of the other stuff.
