# Big Sheet 

#### Hey im Louis, I study computer science in Germany.

## What is this?

This is a collection of videos, my own transcripts and code implementations

So as not to be misunderstood: This is not a study plan that you have to go through from front to back, but a summary of the topics I learned during my studies and from myself. So most of the stuff can be learned without much knowledge of the other stuff.

To learn with this repo, you should know the basics of a programming language you like. If you are completely new to programming, I recommend learning the basics of a language first. Under programming languages, I've listed a few [videos](big-sheet/programming-languages) for learning the basics of Python and Java


#### Required:

* Basics of coding (variables, operators, conditions, loops, methods/functions, etc)
* Patience
* Time
