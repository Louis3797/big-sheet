# Programming Languages

If you want to work with this repo, you should know the basics of a programming language. I recommend Python or Java for this. But in the end it is up to you which one you want to use.

## Python

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its sophisticated built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for rapid application development as well as for use as a scripting language. Python's simple, easy-to-learn syntax emphasizes readability and reduces program maintenance costs. Python supports modules and packages, which promotes program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and extensive standard library are available for free in source or binary form for all major platforms and can be freely distributed.
